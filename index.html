                    Our team has helped hundreds of clients to build strength, drop body fat, gain lean muscle,

                    Start with simple goals and then progress to longer range goals.
                     Remember to make your goals realistic and achievable.
                     It's easy to get frustrated and give up if your goals are too ambitious.

                <p>
                    If you work from home, stretch, walk or climb your stairs on breaks. Or do squats, lunges or situps. 
                    Walk your dog if you have one. Pedal a stationary bike, walk or jog on a treadmill, 
                    or do strength training exercises during your lunch break or while you watch TV at night.
