                <p>
                    When I first began my adventure with fitness I was anything but the picture of health. 
                    I was very overweight and I realized it was because of eating fast food and drinking 
                    pop and beer on a regular basis. I decided to do something about it.
                     I immersed myself in a new lifestyle and have never regretted it.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I did, however, have multiple ups and downs. It took me years to make a decision to 
                    thoroughly examine my workouts and make necessary changes.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Learning about the benefits of Metabolic Training and HIIT entirely transformed my body.
                     What I enjoy the most about it is that there is minimal or even NO equipment required 
                     and you can do it anytime and anywhere
                </p>
